Jinja2 Changelog
===============

Version 2.0
-----------
(codename to be selected, release around July 2008)

- the subscribing of objects (looking up attributes and items) changed from
  slightly.  It's now possible to give attributes or items a higher priority
  by either using dot-notation lookup or the bracket syntax.  This also
  changed the AST slightly.  `Subscript` is gone and was replaced with
  :class:`~jinja2.nodes.Getitem` and :class:`~jinja2.nodes.Getattr`.

  For more information see :ref:`the implementation details <notes-on-subscribing>`.

- added support for preprocessing and token stream filtering for extensions.
  This would allow extensions to allow simplified gettext calls in template
  data and something similar.

- added :meth:`jinja2.environment.TemplateStream.dump`.

Version 2.0rc1
--------------
(no codename, released on July 9th 2008)

- first release of Jinja2
