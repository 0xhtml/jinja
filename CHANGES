Jinja Changelog
===============

Version 1.1
-----------
(codename to be selected, release date unknown)

- blocks now support ``{{ super() }}`` to render the parent output.

- debugging system improved, smaller filesize for the cached files.
  Debugging works now well for any module using linecache.

- ``{{ debug() }}`` can now be used to get a list of filters and
  tags.

- the template lexer keeps not track of brace, parenthesis and
  bracket balance in order to not break variable tags apart if they
  are configured to look like this: ``${expr}``. This also fixes
  the problem with nested dicts in variable expressions.

- added whitespace management system for the template designer.

- some small bugfixes.

- improved security system regarding function calls.

- added `lipsum` function to generate random text.

- strings without unicode characters are processed as binary strings now
  to workaround problems with `datetime.strftime` which only accepts
  binary strings.

- it's now possible to use newlines in string literals

- developer friendly traceback is now toggleable

- silent variable name failure is now toggleable

- fixed issue with old-style classes not implementing `__getitem__`
  (thanks to Axel BÃ¶hm for discovering that bug)

- added a bunch of new docstrings to the Jinja classes. Makes fun now to
  use pydoc :-)

- fixed severe memcaching bug. Formerly it wasn't possible to use memcaching
  without enabling disk cache.

- fixed a bug that allowed users to override the special names `_`, `true` etc.

- added `batch` and `slice` filters for batching or slicing sequences

- added `sum`, `abs` and `round` filters. This fixes #238

- added `striptags` and `xmlattr` filters for easier SGML/XML processing

- the trans tag does not need explicit naming for variables with the same
  name any more. You can now use ``{% trans foo %}`` instead of the verbose
  version ``{% trans foo=foo %}``.

- reimplemented Buffet plugin so that it works at least for pylons

- added `Environment.get_translations_for_string`

- fixed a bug in the parser that didn't unescape keyword arguments. (thanks
  to Alexey Melchakov for reporting)
